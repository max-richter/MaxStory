Last year Max visited Norway and Sweden to see his cousin Jack. During the trip, he travelled through the fjords and mountains. In Stockholm, he visited many historical areas and ate local food. He was an avid soccer fac so he thoght of going to watch a game of soccer in the Stockholm stadium. But when he went to get some tickets for a game that weekend he found out that all the tickets were sold out. He was very disappointed. He left the stadium and found out that there were a few kids playing soccer on the street. He decided to join. He was very good and won 17 - 0. A recruiter happened to pass by and asked him to join the team. Peter was very Happy and accepted.
